## 📊 Current Capabilities

### ✅ Working Features
1. **Database Management**:
   ```bash
   .venv/bin/python main.py db migrate        # Create/update schema
   .venv/bin/python main.py db status         # Check connection
   .venv/bin/python main.py db process-trades # Create completed trades
   ```

2. **Data Ingestion**:
   ```bash
   .venv/bin/python main.py ingest file data.ndjson          # Ingest single file
   .venv/bin/python main.py ingest file data.ndjson --dry-run # Validate only
   .venv/bin/python main.py ingest batch "*.ndjson"          # Batch processing
   ```

3. **Position & P&L Reporting**:
   ```bash
   .venv/bin/python main.py report positions        # Show all positions
   .venv/bin/python main.py report positions --open-only  # Open positions only
   .venv/bin/python main.py report trades          # Completed trades with P&L
   .venv/bin/python main.py report trades --symbol AAPL   # Filter by symbol
   ```

4. **P&L Engine**: Fully functional average cost basis calculations with automatic position tracking

### ⚠️ Requires Setup
1. **PostgreSQL Database**: User must install and configure PostgreSQL 14+
2. **Environment Variables**: Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure database connection
3. **Database Creation**: Create database named `trading_journal`

### 📋 MVP Workflow Ready
Complete workflow from NDJSON ingestion to P&L reporting is now functional!

### 🎯 Multi-User Support (BONUS Feature)
- [x] **User Management** - User table with authentication
- [x] **API Key Authentication** - Secure API key-based access control
- [x] **Admin Mode** - Development admin access via environment variables
- [x] **User Context** - All data scoped to authenticated user
- [x] **CLI Authentication** - Decorator-based auth for all protected commands

## 🚀 Quick Start (For Development)

1. **Install PostgreSQL 14+**
2. **Create Database**:
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE trading_journal;
   ```
3. **Configure Environment**:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your database credentials
   ```
4. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   uv sync
   ```
5. **Run Migrations**:
   ```bash
   uv run python main.py db migrate
   ```
6. **Create First User**:
   ```bash
   # Enable admin mode for initial setup
   export ADMIN_MODE_ENABLED=true
   export ADMIN_MODE_USER_ID=1

   # Create user and get API key
   uv run python create_user.py
   ```
7. **Set API Key & Verify**:
   ```bash
   export TRADING_JOURNAL_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   uv run python main.py db status
   ```

## 📝 Notes

- **TDD Approach**: All future implementation should follow test-driven development
- **Database First**: Schema is production-ready for PostgreSQL
- **Extensible Design**: Architecture supports all PRD requirements
- **Performance Ready**: Indexes designed for 10k+ records in <5s target

The foundation is solid and ready for P&L engine implementation.
